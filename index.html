      <section>
        <p>The book <em>Algorithms 4th Edition</em> contains Java implementations for many fundamental algorithms "<em>the 50 algorithms that every programmer should know</em>". The authors created a website, <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/">http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/</a> where all the code for the book is published as a class library <em>algs4</em> (including additional code that was omitted from the book itself for brevity reasons). </p>

<p>Personally I prefer using C# so I have decided to re-implement algs4 in C# (some reasons I like C# is because it has been evolving from an original "very Java-like" object oriented language into a very flexible multi-paradigm language, and also because I like the tools in Visual Studio better than the equivalent tools for Java)</p>

<p>I am trying to preserve the original APIs with minimal changes, extending them in some cases. If there is java code that uses the original algs4 I want it to be easy to port to C# using my re-implementation. On the other hand I use static code and style checking extensively (fxcop, stylecop and similar tools) and my code follows C# style rules (e.g., in terms of capitalization). An additional porting effort will be required, it will not be a drop-in replacement.</p>

<p>The original algs4 mixes executable clients with the libraries themselves. I have separated the client code into test projects. Initially I'm expecting this to provide some degree of Unit testing. Eventually (after I get to implement the entire algs4 library) I may re-visit the Unit Tests to make them more exhaustive (and "real unit tests")</p>

<p>Sedgewick &amp; Wayne also wrote the book <em>Introduction to Programming in Java</em> and an associated class library <em>stdlib</em> that they use in the algs4 code. I will re-implement some portions of stdlib as I need but I do not expect it to be complete, and my target quality level for stdlib is that it is "good enough" (e.g., for I/O functions I will not try to make it solid to deal with the many types of failure that can happen)</p>

<p>In terms of licensing, the original algs4 is released as GPLv3. In the Q&amp;A section of the original code it says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our libraries stdlib.jar and algs4.jar are released under the GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPLv3). If you wish to license the code under different terms, please contact our publisher to discuss. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My re-implementation is also released under the same terms. Personally I would have chosen a less restrictive licensing. If you can get the original owners of algs4 to agree to different terms, please let me know and I'll release my re-implementation with a less restrictive license</p>

<p>If you'd like to contact me regarding this code, please email algs4 (hyphen) csharp (dot) nospam (at) rufian (dot) zilbermann (dot) org</p>
